**HIGHLY UNSTABLE**

Chainable SSL implementation for [libuv][0] based on [uv_link_t][1].

## Why?

Doing SSL asynchronously is hard. This project provides abstract interface that
works well with the event loop model of [libuv][0].

## How?

The decoupled interface backend is provided by [uv_link_t][1], and is used
extensively in this project.

Example is available [here][2].
